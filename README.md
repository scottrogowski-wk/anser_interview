# The task

In this assignment, you will be analyzing historical weather data for the city of Boulder, Colorado. You're provided with two text files, `boulder_temperature.txt`, and `boulder_preciptiation.txt`, along with a script, `show_weather.py`. Modify the script to:

  1. Accept the two file paths as command line arguments

  2. Read in all the data

  3. Output a CSV file with the combined dataset

  4. Visually display a few graphs and statistics around Boulder's weather. You have two audiences. The first is a person who is thinking about moving to Boulder and wants to know what it's like. The second is a scientist interested in how Boulder's weather has changed over the past few decades. This is your chance to shine so give this aspect all you've got. You can use any framework you are comfortable in. Matplotlib is a good standard option. If you want to use something like hipsterplot or write html and utilize D3, more power to you.

When you've succeeded, tar your directory and send it back

Note: Be careful! The data is real world data and as-such, it may need some sanitizing.

# Evaluation

We will be looking for a few things:

  1. Does your code execute?

  2. Is your code sane and readable?

  3. Do you output a combined csv file?

  4. Are you generating a clean, useful dashboard?

  5. How well are you catering to your audience?
